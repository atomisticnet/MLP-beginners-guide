bfgs

# Regularization can generally help to improve forces, but I have not
# tested it much (with or without force training); I implemented L2 and
# L1 regularization, but I recommend L2 for BFGS.  The parameter is
# related to the lowest error in the fit that can be achieved, so if the
# parameter is too high, the error of the potential will not go down.

# REGULARIZATION
# l2=0.0001
