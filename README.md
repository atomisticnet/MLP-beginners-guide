# ANN Potential Tutorial

A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the construction of artificial neural network (ANN) interatomic potentials can be found in [./tutorial/aenet_tutorial_beginners_guide.ipynb](./tutorial/aenet_tutorial_beginners_guide.ipynb).  The notebook can be run directly using *Google Colaboratory* and is also shared at the following link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K7uhrUxmM0g7OERWzhSudtCdiVhfX_ul?usp=sharing

# ANN Potential Failure Analysis

In the manuscript, the failure of an initial water potential during a molecular dynamics simulations is discussed.  The analysis shown in **Figure 10** of the manuscript can be reproduced using another Jupyter notebook provided here in [./script-Fig10/analysis_water_trajectory.ipynb](./script-Fig10/analysis_water_trajectory.ipynb).
